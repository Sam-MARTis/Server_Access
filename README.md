# Hello there!

This is for the purpose of resume verification.
1) I host servers that run a fair amount of stuff. One of the more appealing ones is a media server.

A media server is where you can store videos, photos...and in my case, movies.
To access the media server, you need to connect to the IITB intranet.
COnnect to IITB wireless or Eduroam or any internal network within the institute. 
Then visit the following url:
[10.9.69.26](https://10.9.69.26:32400/web/index.html)

Ignore the safety warning as you will be taken to my server site:

This is where you want to be.

I obviously wont give you the login credentials, but you know it exists.


2) Website
Just like how you visit the port 32400 of the above ip for plex, you can visit a different port, namely the https port
https://10.9.69.26/

That will redirect you to the following:

3) SSH and sensor monitoring
An obvious must-have for any server is ssh-access.

The ROOM variable is the external ip of the server that anyone from within the institute can access. This allows me to constantly manage all my servers from anywhere within the insti


Lessons from the servers overheating have led me to install sensor software that monitors the vitalss of the system.





4) Julia computing.

No need for people to go though the hassle of installing Julia to try out and see how awesome it is. All you have to do in login, decide if the language is for you (and ofc it is. Its Julia)
